I am currently a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/csit/">Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT)</a> at <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/">Queenâ€™s University Belfast (QUB)</a>. I hold a B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. in Computer Engineering, specializing in machine learning and cybersecurity.

Previously, I worked on computer vision and generative AI projects at the <a href="https://tubitak.gov.tr/en">Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkiye (TUBITAK)</a>, <a href="https://bilgem.tubitak.gov.tr/en/">Informatics and Information Security Research Center (BILGEM)</a> as a Principal Applied Scientist.

Before that, I was an AI Tech Lead and Senior AI Research Engineer at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a>, leading Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks for large-scale advertising projects. During this time, I was honored with the Sparkling Star and Consumer Cloud Service President awards. Additionally, I spearheaded a TUBITAK University-Industry collaboration project between <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a>, where I had the privilege of working alongside esteemed professors <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~toroslu/">Prof. Ismail Hakki Toroslu</a>, <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~karagoz/">Prof. Pinar Karagoz</a>, and <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~altingovde/">Prof. Ismail Sengor Altingovde</a>.

Besides my industry experience, I focused on machine learning solutions for intrusion detection systems during my Ph.D. and M.Sc. studies under the supervision of <a href='https://avesis.iuc.edu.tr/aydinali/'>Prof. M. Ali Aydin</a>, while also serving as a Research and Teaching Assistant. Earlier, in my B.Sc., alongside coursework such as artificial intelligence, programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java), data structures, algorithms, cybersecurity, and linear algebra, I founded a start-up company, Aksu Informatics, supported by a techno-initiative capital program from the Ministry of Science, Industry, and Technology. I developed AI software solutions for individuals with disabilities, such as ALS.

With a deep interest in deep learning and cybersecurity, I have extensive experience in building advanced ML/DL models using Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and have been proficient in Python since 2014.

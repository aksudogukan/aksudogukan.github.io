I am currently a Research Fellow at the <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/research-centres/csit/">Centre for Secure Information Technologies (CSIT)</a> at <a href="https://www.qub.ac.uk/">Queenâ€™s University Belfast (QUB)</a>, where I have the privilege of collaborating with <a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/ihsen-alouani">Assoc. Prof. Ihsen Alouani</a> and <a href="https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/persons/jesus-martinez-del-rincon">Prof. Jesus Martinez del Rincon</a> on cutting-edge research projects in AI and Cybersecurity. I hold a B.Sc. (2015), M.Sc. (2018), and Ph.D. (2022) in Computer Engineering, specializing in machine learning and cybersecurity.

Previously, I worked at the <a href="https://tubitak.gov.tr/en">Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkiye (TUBITAK)</a>, <a href="https://bilgem.tubitak.gov.tr/en/">Informatics and Information Security Research Center (BILGEM)</a> as a Principal Applied Scientist and AI Tech Lead.

Prior to that, I spent two years at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> as a Tech Lead and Senior AI Research Engineer, leading Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks for large-scale advertising projects. During this time, I was honored with the Sparkling Star and Consumer Cloud Service President awards. Additionally, I spearheaded a TUBITAK 1505 University-Industry collaboration project between <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a>, where I had the privilege of working alongside esteemed professors <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~toroslu/">Prof. Ismail Hakki Toroslu</a>, <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~karagoz/">Prof. Pinar Karagoz</a>, and <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~altingovde/">Prof. Ismail Sengor Altingovde</a>.

My academic journey included a focus on machine learning solutions for intrusion detection systems under the supervision of <a href="https://avesis.iuc.edu.tr/aydinali/">Prof. M. Ali Aydin</a> during my Ph.D. and M.Sc. studies. Earlier, during my B.Sc., alongside my coursework in artificial intelligence, programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java), data structures, algorithms, cybersecurity, statistics, and more, I founded a start-up company, Aksu Informatics, supported by a techno-initiative capital program from the Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology. I focused on developing AI software solutions for individuals with disabilities, such as ALS.

With a deep interest in deep learning and cybersecurity, I have extensive experience in building advanced ML/DL models using Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and have been proficient in Python since 2014.

I am currently an AI Tech Lead & Principal AI Scientist at the <a href="https://tubitak.gov.tr/en">Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey (TUBITAK)</a>, <a href="https://bilgem.tubitak.gov.tr/en/">Informatics and Information Security Research Center (BILGEM)</a>. I hold a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.istanbul.edu.tr/en/_">Istanbul University<a/>, earned in 2015 and 2018, respectively, and a Ph.D. in Computer Engineering from <a href="https://www.iuc.edu.tr/en/_">Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa</a>, completed in 2022.

Before my current role at  <a href="https://bilgem.tubitak.gov.tr/en/">TUBITAK BILGEM</a>, I spent two years at <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> as a Tech Lead and Senior AI Research Engineer, where I led Click Through Rate (CTR) prediction tasks for large-scale advertising projects. During this time, I was honored with the Sparkling Star and Consumer Cloud Service President awards. Additionally, I spearheaded a TUBITAK 1505 University-Industry collaboration project between <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/">Huawei</a> and <a href="https://www.metu.edu.tr/">Middle East Technical University (METU)</a>, where I had the privilege of working alongside esteemed professors such as <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~toroslu/">Prof. Ismail Hakki Toroslu</a>, <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~karagoz/">Prof. Pinar Karagoz</a>, and <a href="https://user.ceng.metu.edu.tr/~altingovde/">Prof. Ismail Sengor Altingovde<a>.

My academic journey included a focus on machine learning solutions for intrusion detection systems under the supervision of <a href="https://avesis.iuc.edu.tr/aydinali">Assoc. Prof. M. Ali Aydin</a> during my Ph.D. and M.Sc. studies. Earlier, during my B.Sc., alongside my coursework in programming languages (C, C++, C#, Java), data structures, algorithms, and statistics, I founded a start-up company, Aksu Informatics, in the Incubation Center of Istanbul University, supported by a techno-initiative capital program from the Ministry of Industry and Technology of Turkey. I focused on developing AI software for individuals with disabilities, such as ALS.

With a deep interest in deep learning and cybersecurity, I have extensive experience in building advanced ML/DL models using Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and have been proficient in Python since 2014.

This is some random text. -- this should change frontend. Hello World! BurdayÄ±m asc
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
